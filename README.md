# Todo PWA

This is an experiment with Progressive Web Applications. It is not, itself, actually a good application! Please see the
[blog post](https://goo.gl/a7Cz5L) for more details about the code.

## Instructions

This is fairly simple to set up and run.

### Prerequisites

- You need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), of course.
- Also [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

### Set Up Mongo

- Create a database in Mongo. Call it `todo`.
- Create a single `todos` collection in the database

### Installing / Running

- Clone / Download the repo.
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Set up an environment variable for the database - `MONGODB_URI` = `mongodb://localhost:27017/todo`
- Run the application with `npm start`.
- Visit `http://localhost:3000/index.html` in a browser
